# Building Event-Driven Microservices - Adam Bellemare
## Why Event-Driven Microservices?

You need only look at the his‐
tory of computing inventions to see how network communications, relational data‐bases, big-data developments, and cloud computing have significantly altered how
architectures are built and how work is performed. Each of these inventions changed not only the way that technology was used within various software projects, but also
the way that organizations, teams, and people communicated with one another. From
centralized mainframes to distributed mobile applications, each new medium has
fundamentally changed people’s relationship with computing.


## What Are Event-Driven Microservices?
Microservices and microservice-style architectures have existed for many years, in
many different forms, under many different names. Service-oriented architectures
(SOAs) are often composed of multiple microservices synchronously communicating
directly with one another. Message-passing architectures use consumable events to
asynchronously communicate with one another. Event-based communication is certainly not new, but the need for handling big data sets, at scale and in real time, is new
and necessitates a change from the old architectural styles.

<br/>
In a modern event-driven microservices architecture, systems communicate by issuing and consuming events. These events are not destroyed upon consumption as inmessage-passing systems, but instead remain readily available for other consumers to
read as they require.
