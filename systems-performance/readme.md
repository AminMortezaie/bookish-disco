# Systems Performance - Second Edition - Brendan Gregg

## Systems Performance
Systems performance studies the performance of an entire computer system, including all major 
software and hardware components.
<br/>

Anything in the data path, from storage devices to application software, is included, because it can affect performance. 
<br/>

If you don’t have a diagram of your environment showing the 
data path, find one or draw it yourself; this will help you understand the relationships between 
components and ensure that you don’t overlook entire areas.
