# Withdraw System Design
Requirements:
1. The **user interface component** allows users to input the amount they wish to withdraw, the recipient's blockchain address, and any required encryption information.
2. The **input validation component** verifies that the user's input meets the system's constraints and requirements.
3. The **transaction generation component** creates a transaction on the desire network, specifying the transfer of funds from the user's account to the recipient's blockchain address.
4. The **encryption component** securely encrypts the transaction using P2P encryption.
5. The **broadcast component** transmits the encrypted transaction to the Cosmos network.
6. The **confirmation component** verifies that the transaction has been confirmed by the network.
7. The **funds transfer component** transfers the specified amount from the user's account to the recipient's account.
8. The **database component** updates the system's records to reflect the successful transaction.

## Encryption Component
The encryption component is responsible for securely encrypting the transaction to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. In the case of a P2P encryption, the encryption is applied end-to-end, meaning that the data is encrypted on the sender's system and decrypted on the recipient's system.
### Using AES
One of the best encryption algorithms that can be used for P2P transactions is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. This makes it well-suited for P2P transactions, where the sender and recipient both need access to the encryption key.

### Using RSA
Another encryption algorithm that could be used for P2P transactions is RSA encryption. RSA encryption works by encrypting the data with the recipient's public key and decrypting it with the recipient's private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can access the data, as the private key is kept confidential and protected from unauthorized access.


## Input Validation Component
For a withdrawal system, common input validation checks might include:

1. Verifying that the specified amount is within the allowed transaction limits, such as minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts.
2. Verifying that the recipient's blockchain address is valid and exists on the desire network.
3. Verifying that the encryption information provided by the user is valid and sufficient to securely encrypt the transaction.
4. Verifying that the user's account has sufficient funds to cover the specified withdrawal amount.

## Transaction Generation Component

1. The component gathers the required information from the user, including the amount to be withdrawn, the recipient's blockchain address, and any encryption information provided.
2. The component creates a transaction object that specifies the transfer of funds from the user's account to the recipient's blockchain address.
3. The component signs the transaction with the user's private key(For RSA) to confirm the user's authorization for the transaction.
4. The component broadcasts the transaction to the desire network.
