# Withdraw System Design
Requirements:
1. The **user interface component** allows users to input the amount they wish to withdraw, the recipient's blockchain address, and any required encryption information.
2. The **input validation component** verifies that the user's input meets the system's constraints and requirements.
3. The **transaction generation component** creates a transaction on the desire network, specifying the transfer of funds from the user's account to the recipient's blockchain address.
4. The **encryption component** securely encrypts the transaction using P2P encryption.
5. The **broadcast component** transmits the encrypted transaction to the Cosmos network.
6. The **confirmation component** verifies that the transaction has been confirmed by the network.
7. The **funds transfer component** transfers the specified amount from the user's account to the recipient's account.
8. The **database component** updates the system's records to reflect the successful transaction.

## Encryption Component
The encryption component is responsible for securely encrypting the transaction to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. In the case of a P2P encryption, the encryption is applied end-to-end, meaning that the data is encrypted on the sender's system and decrypted on the recipient's system.
### Using AES
One of the best encryption algorithms that can be used for P2P transactions is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. This makes it well-suited for P2P transactions, where the sender and recipient both need access to the encryption key.

### Using RSA
Another encryption algorithm that could be used for P2P transactions is RSA encryption. RSA encryption works by encrypting the data with the recipient's public key and decrypting it with the recipient's private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can access the data, as the private key is kept confidential and protected from unauthorized access.


## Input Validation Component
For a withdrawal system, common input validation checks might include:

1. Verifying that the specified amount is within the allowed transaction limits, such as minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts.
2. Verifying that the recipient's blockchain address is valid and exists on the desire network.
3. Verifying that the encryption information provided by the user is valid and sufficient to securely encrypt the transaction.
4. Verifying that the user's account has sufficient funds to cover the specified withdrawal amount.

## Transaction Generation Component

1. The component gathers the required information from the user, including the amount to be withdrawn, the recipient's blockchain address, and any encryption information provided.
2. The component creates a transaction object that specifies the transfer of funds from the user's account to the recipient's blockchain address.
3. The component signs the transaction with the user's private key (for RSA) to confirm the user's authorization for the transaction.
4. The component broadcasts the transaction to the desire network.

It's important to note that the transaction generation component is responsible for ensuring that the transaction is created in accordance with the desire network's standards and protocols.
This may involve, for example, converting the specified amount into the appropriate units and formatting the transaction data in a specific way.

Once the transaction is broadcast to the network, it is processed and confirmed by the network's nodes, which ensure that the transaction is valid and that the sender's account has sufficient funds to cover the specified amount.

## Broadcast Component
This component is being processed in the network core, and there is no need to implement.

but Here's a general overview of the steps involved in broadcasting a transaction:
1. The component receives the signed transaction from the transaction generation component.
2. The component serializes the transaction into a format that can be transmitted over the network, such as a binary or hexadecimal format.
3. The component transmits the serialized transaction to the network, using a protocol such as TCP/IP.
4. The component listens for confirmation of the transaction from the network.

## Confirmation Component
Here's a general overview of the steps involved in confirming a transaction:
1. The component receives the broadcast transaction from the broadcast component.
2. The component verifies the transaction by checking that it is properly signed, that the specified amount is within the allowed limits, and that the sender's account has sufficient funds to cover the specified amount.
3. The component updates the user's account balance to reflect the transferred amount.
4. The component broadcasts the updated account balance to the network to ensure that all nodes have a consistent view of the current state of the network.

It's important to ensure that the confirmation component implements appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized transactions and to protect the integrity of the network's ledger.
This may involve, for example, using encryption to secure the account information and implementing access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and systems can modify the account balances.

It's also important to ensure that the confirmation component is highly available and scalable, to ensure that transactions can be confirmed quickly and reliably, even in the event of high demand or network congestion. 

## Strategies for low latency and high availability in Confirmation
The component may implement strategies such as load balancing, failover, and replication to ensure that it can handle a high volume of transactions while maintaining low latency and high availability.
