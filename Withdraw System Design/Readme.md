# Withdraw System Design
Requirements:
1. The **user interface component** allows users to input the amount they wish to withdraw, the recipient's blockchain address, and any required encryption information.
2. The **input validation component** verifies that the user's input meets the system's constraints and requirements.
3. The **transaction generation component** creates a transaction on the Cosmos network, specifying the transfer of funds from the user's account to the recipient's blockchain address.
4. The **encryption component** securely encrypts the transaction using P2P encryption.
5. The **broadcast component** transmits the encrypted transaction to the Cosmos network.
6. The **confirmation component** verifies that the transaction has been confirmed by the network.
7. The **funds transfer component** transfers the specified amount from the user's account to the recipient's account.
8. The **database component** updates the system's records to reflect the successful transaction.

## Encryption Component
The encryption component is responsible for securely encrypting the transaction to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. In the case of a P2P encryption, the encryption is applied end-to-end, meaning that the data is encrypted on the sender's system and decrypted on the recipient's system.
### Using AES
One of the best encryption algorithms that can be used for P2P transactions is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. This makes it well-suited for P2P transactions, where the sender and recipient both need access to the encryption key.
